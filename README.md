# üê∂ Dog Breed Identification

This project focuses on **classifying dog breeds** using **Deep Learning** techniques in **Google Colab**.  
It was built around the Kaggle [Dog Breed Identification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification) and demonstrates how to preprocess large image datasets, build deep learning pipelines, and train a model to achieve competitive accuracy.

## üîç Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict a dog‚Äôs breed from an input image.  
We follow a complete machine learning pipeline starting from **data extraction** to **model evaluation** and **Kaggle submission**.

### Steps Covered:
1. **Dataset Extraction**  
   - The dataset was provided as a `.zip` file.  
   - Extracted in Google Colab using `unzip`.  
   - Train and test folders contain images for classification.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded image paths and corresponding labels from `labels.csv`.  
   - Converted labels into categorical format for model training.  
   - Applied normalization (scaling pixel values between 0‚Äì1).  
   - Resized all images to a fixed shape for consistency.  

3. **Batching & Data Loading**  
   - Used TensorFlow/Keras data generators to load images in **batches** (instead of loading everything into memory).  
   - Applied **image augmentation** techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to make the model more robust.  

4. **Model Building**  
   - Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.  
   - Key layers included:
     - Convolution layers for feature extraction  
     - Pooling layers for dimensionality reduction  
     - Dense layers for classification  
   - Softmax activation in the final layer to output probabilities for each dog breed.  

5. **Training & Validation**  
   - Compiled the model with **categorical crossentropy loss** and **Adam optimizer**.  
   - Trained on the training set with a validation split to monitor performance.  
   - Used **early stopping** to prevent overfitting.  
   - Training was accelerated using GPU runtime in Colab.  

6. **Evaluation**  
   - Checked model accuracy and loss curves to track learning progress.  
   - Generated predictions on the test set.  
   - Converted predictions into the required `.csv` format for Kaggle submission.

## üìä Results

- The CNN was able to classify multiple dog breeds with good accuracy on validation data.  
- Data augmentation and batch processing helped improve generalization.  
- A submission file (`submission.csv`) was successfully generated for Kaggle.
